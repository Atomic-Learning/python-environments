In Python, an environment is a self-contained directory that contains a specific version of Python and a set of installed packages. Environments allow you to manage dependencies for different projects without conflicts.

There may be multiple environments on a single machine, each with its own versions of Python and packages. This is particularly useful when working on projects that require different versions of libraries or Python itself.

Common tools for managing Python environments include:
- **venv**: A built-in module in Python 3 that allows you to create lightweight virtual environments.
- **Anaconda**: A distribution of Python that includes a package manager (conda) and tools for creating and managing environments.
